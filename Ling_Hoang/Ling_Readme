# Water Quality Predictor # 

### Goal ### 

To predict the water quality of a specific body of water for recreational use and potability. And using Machine Learning Models for predicting the water quality index in Lake Sammamish which is 8 miles east of Seattle in King County, Washington, United States.

Our Initial hypothesises:
  - Is the water safe for recreational activities?
  - Is the water safe to drink?
  - What is the water temperature?

### Resources ### 

We used [King County](https://green2.kingcounty.gov/lakes/Query.aspx) website to pull all the database for Lake Sammamish. This included 7 sites with 14 water parameters. 

We also read this article on [Using Machine Learning Models for Predicting the Water Quality Index in the La Buong River, Vietnam](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/10/1552) to calculate the water quality index for Lake Sammamish, and how this case study using different machine learning models to apply on our dataset. 

### Database ###

![Database](https://github.com/gothwalritu/Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp/blob/Erica_Gutierrez/QuickDBD-export.png)

There are 7 test sites at Lake Sammamish and we will analyze and combine all the test site to run the machine learning models. 

### Segment 1 ###

Goal: 
  - Data Exploratory inducluding removal of un-related parameters. 
  - Tranform any data that needed to be transform. 
  - Combine all testing sites after data has been cleaned. 

```
    Import and sanitize the 1st set of Lake Sammamish Data = WQ0611

    # Load the file data into the path
    file_path = "../GroupProject/Resources/Lake_Sammamish_0611.csv"

    # Load the file_path data into dataframe
    WQ0611_df = pd.read_csv(file_path, skiprows=12, encoding='unicode_escape', on_bad_lines='skip')

    # Show the WQ dataframe 
    WQ0611_df.head(10)
  
```
Since the csv file from King County contains extra information on the top of the file, we must import it without the first 12 rows. The import results in 10 rows and 36 columns. 

```
  # Drop all the qualifiers 
     WQ0611_df = WQ0611_df.drop(columns=["Depth (m)", "Ammmonia Nitrogen Qualifier*", "Cond Qualifier*", "DO Qualifier*", "Ecoli Qualifier*", 
     "Fecal Coliform Qualifier*","Nitrate Nitrite Qualifier*", "OP Qualifier*", "pH Qualifier*", "Temperature Qualifier*", "TN Qualifier*", 
     "TP Qualifier*", "Total Alkalinity Qualifier*"])

  # Drop all the MDL columns
    WQ0611_df = WQ0611_df.drop(columns=["AN MDL (mg/L)", "Cond MDL (Âµmhos/cm)", "DO MDL (mg/L)", "Nitrate Nitrite MDL (mg/L)", "OP MDL (mg/L)", 
    "TN MDL (mg/L)", "TP MDL (mg/L)", "Total Alkalinity MDL (mg/L)"])
  
```
After the first look at overall data, we decided to drop all qualifiers columns and all the MDL columns since it doesn't have the importance in calculating the water quality index. 

```
    WQ0611_df = WQ0611_df.drop(columns=["Unnamed: 35", "Ecoli", "Total Alkalinity (mg/L)"])
    
```
We also dropped those extra columns since it not needed. This dropped results in 10033 rows and 12 columns. 

```
    # Convert string to datetime
      WQ0611_df["CollectDate"] = pd.to_datetime(WQ0611_df["CollectDate"])

    # Apply lambda function to fill NaN space. 
      df_2 = df_1.groupby(["CollectDate"]).apply(lambda x:x.fillna(x.mean()))

    # Drop all NaN column
      df_3 = df_2.dropna()

    # Check the number of columns after dropping all Nan values
      df_3.count()
    
```

This result in total of 3015 rows and 11 columns.

In this first segment, we all cleaning this raw dataset together so everyone can be familiar with the data and all the paramenters that was kept for future use. 

After this, one of my teammate Ritu will append all the data of all the testing site and we will download that data for future use. 

The reason why we decided to have 1 person append all the testing sites was data inconsistency. Although we tried to download the dataset from 1 source, we all have different number in columns and rows. 

### Segment 2 ###

![](https://github.com/gothwalritu/Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp/blob/Ling_Hoang/Segment%201/Surfing%20the%20neural%20net.png)

After looking at this graph, we decided to test the data out with Linear/Logistic Regression for high interpretability/low accuracy and Random Forest for medium interpretability/high accuracy. 

Goal:
-	Applied 2 machine learning models to the entire lake dataset 
-	See if logistic regression model is working
-	See if random forest model is working

Tasks:
-	Applied logistic regression model on testing site 0611
-	Applied random forest model on testing site 0611 
- Comparing result on 0611 testing site with the entire lake dataset

# Logistic Regression Model for 0611 testing site # 

```
    # Seperate the Features (X) from the Target (y)
    y = df_3['WQ']
    X = df_3.drop(['WQ', 'CollectDate'], axis='columns')

    # Split our data into training and testing 
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y,random_state=42)
    X_train.shape

    # Create a Logistic Regression Model
    classifier = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs', random_state=0)
    classifier
    classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
  
```
Problem encountered:
-	Data was continuous => The solution was to convert the data to able to run the model. 


```
    # Import model for convert data
    from sklearn import preprocessing
    from sklearn import utils

    # Convert y values to categorical values
    lab = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()
    y_transformed = lab.fit_transform(y)

    # Prediction outcomes for test data set 
    predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)
    results = pd.DataFrame({"Prediction": predictions, "Actual": y_test}).reset_index(drop=True)
    results.head(20)

    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    print(accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))

```

Result:

Accuracy Score is 0.0 

# Random Forest Model for 0611 testing site #

```
    # Define the features set
    X = WQ0611_clean_df.copy()
    X = X.drop(['WQ','CollectDate'], axis='columns')
    X.head()

    # Define the target set.
    y = WQ0611_clean_df["WQ"].ravel()
    y[:20]

    # Splitting into Train and Test sets.
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=78)

    # Creating a StandardScaler instance.
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    # Fitting the Standard Scaler with the training data.
    X_scaler = scaler.fit(X_train)

    # Scaling the data.
    X_train_scaled = X_scaler.transform(X_train)
    X_test_scaled = X_scaler.transform(X_test)

    # Fit the random forest classifier
    # Create a random forest classifier.
    rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=128, random_state=78)

    # Fitting the model
    rf_model = rf_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

    # Making predictions using the testing data.
    predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test_scaled)

    # Calculating the confusion matrix.
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)

    # Create a DataFrame from the confusion matrix.
    cm_df = pd.DataFrame(
        cm, index=["Actual 0", "Actual 1", "Actual 2", "Actual 3", "Actual 4", "Actual 5"],
        columns=["Predicted 0", "Predicted 1", "Predicted 2", "Predicted 3", "Predicted 4", "Predicted 5"])

## Dashboard Exploration in Segment 2: ## 

Goal: 
    -	Visualization between lake parameters over time from 1994 to 2008
    -	Frequency of parameter over time 
    -	Depth visualization (optional) since depth was removed during data cleaning process. 

This is the visual that show each parameter over period of time. As we can see, the peak was during 1996 and 2006. 

![Parameter over time](https://github.com/gothwalritu/Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp/blob/Ling_Hoang/Code%20and%20Visual%20Snippets/Parameters_Over_Time.png)

This is the visual heatmap between the average number of each parameter over period of time. The darker the color, the higher the number. The main point is to compare the mean of parameters with the mean of water quality index from 1994 to 2008.

![Heatmap]([https://github.com/gothwalritu/Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp/blob/Ling_Hoang/Ling_Hoang/Code%20and%20Visual%20Snippets/Heatmap.png](https://github.com/gothwalritu/Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp/blob/Ling_Hoang/Code%20and%20Visual%20Snippets/Heatmap.png))

Frequency of distinct time each number of parameters appear during those months from 1994 to 2008.

![Frequency](https://github.com/gothwalritu/Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp/blob/Ling_Hoang/Code%20and%20Visual%20Snippets/Frequency%20of%20AmmoniaNitrogen.png)

## Dashboard Exploratory in Segment 3: ##

Problem from previous Segment:

-	The heatmap doesnât related nor adding any story to the main project. 
-	Need to show a correlation as scatter plot. 

Goal: 

-	Have more scatter plot with linear regression line with all the parameters.
- Google Slide for individual presentation. 

![Correlation between Ammonia and WQI](https://github.com/gothwalritu/Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp/blob/Ling_Hoang/Segment_3/Corr%20Ammonia%20vs%20WQI.png)

This graph shows the correlation between Ammonia Nitrogen and WQI. The R-Squared is 0.0038556 and P-value is 0.390971. As we can see, the correlation in this graph is low since the plot is very scattered away from the linear line. 


 | Parameters Correlation | Parameters Correlation | Parameters Correlation |
| :---:         |     :---:      |    :---:   |
| ![Corr1](https://github.com/gothwalritu/Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp/blob/Ling_Hoang/Segment_3/Correlation(1).png)   | ![Corr2](https://github.com/gothwalritu/Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp/blob/Ling_Hoang/Segment_3/Correlation(2).png)     | ![Corr3](https://github.com/gothwalritu/Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp/blob/Ling_Hoang/Segment_3/Correlation(3).png)    |


In these correlations between all parameter with WQI, we can see Dissolved Oxygen, Fecal Coliform, Nitrate Nitrite and Total Nitrogen has a stronger correlation with WQI accodring to the graph since the plot density is more comparing to other parameters such as Ammonia, Conductivity, Orthphosphate Phosphate, PH, Temperature and Total Phosphorus. 

This is where you can find the [Tableau link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ling7171/viz/CorrelationatLakeSammamish/WQI) for further details.

### Segment 4 ###

After finishing all the visual and preparing for the presentation. I went back and double-checked on both of my models and apparently I found some errors that I decided to debug on. And here are the new result that I found with some comparision code snippets.

At first, this is what I noticed and here if the accuracy score after I debugged. 

Let's start with Logistic Regression model. 

| Accuracy Score with Error | Accuracy Score without Error |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![LR_Before](https://github.com/gothwalritu/Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp/blob/Ling_Hoang/Segment_4/BL_Logistic_Regression_AccuracyScore_Before.png) | ![LR_After](https://github.com/gothwalritu/Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp/blob/Ling_Hoang/Segment_4/BL_Logistic_Regression_AccuracyScore_After.png) |

As we can see, the accuracy score has been improved from 0% to 66%. 

During the exploratory, I started with the solver. In the beginning, the solver was set as 'lbfgs' but after learning from skiitlearn, I switched it into 'newton-cg' and it worked.
